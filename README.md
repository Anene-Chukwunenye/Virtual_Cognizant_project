# Cognizant_Virtual_project

This was a practical project designed as a virtual internship by Forage, whereby I was to use my skills as a data scientist to build an efficient model that would be able to increase profit and reduce waste in a grocery store chain. The model used different datasets to predict the accurate amount of produce needed by the grocery store hourly.
